# Customer Churn Prediction System

An end-to-end machine learning system that predicts which customers will leave and provides actionable recommendations for retention teams. Built on the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Model Performance

After comparing 3 models, Logistic Regression was selected as the winner.

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 80.4% | 64.8% | 57.5% | 60.9% |
| Random Forest | 78.8% | 62.3% | 50.8% | 56.0% |
| Decision Tree | 71.6% | 46.6% | 46.0% | 46.3% |

**Confusion Matrix (Logistic Regression)**
```
                Predicted
              No     Yes
Actual  No   1034     113
        Yes    84     176
```

## Key Insights from EDA

| Finding | Business Impact |
|---------|-----------------|
| Month-to-month contracts | 15x higher churn risk than 2-year contracts |
| First 6 months | 109% higher churn risk (critical window) |
| Electronic check | 45% churn vs 16% for autopay |
| Monthly bills > $70 | Significantly higher churn |
| Top 3 features | TotalCharges + tenure + MonthlyCharges = 53% of prediction power |

---

## Risk Scoring System

| Risk Level | Probability | Action Required |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| HIGH | 70% - 100% | Call customer immediately, offer retention discount |
| MEDIUM | 40% - 70% | Send targeted email with discount offer |
| LOW | 0% - 40% | Monitor, no immediate action needed |

---

## Highest Risk Profile

- Month-to-month contract
- Tenure less than 6 months
- Monthly charges greater than $70
- Electronic check payment

Projected churn: approximately 75% (compared to 26.6% average)
